    "It provides code for doing computations in $\\text{Dist}(U_n)$ ($n$ arbitrary), the distribution algebra of $U_n$, where $U_n$ is the space of all $n \\times n$ unipotent upper triangular matrices over a field $k$:  \n",

    "\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n",
    "  1 & x_{12} & x_{13} & \\ldots & x_{1n} \\\\\n",

    "A complete understanding of the the paper is by no means necessary.  What is necessary is an understanding of how elements of $\\text{Dist}(U_n)$ are defined (proposition 3.1), that is, as finite $k$-linear combinations of the basis elements $\\alpha(M)$, where $M$ is a strictly upper triangular $n \\times n$ matrix with non-negative integer entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication rule for two basis elements $\\alpha(M)$ and $\\alpha(N)$ can be found in proposition 3.3.  However, the implementation we give instead relies on lemma 6.6, along with the row-wise decomposition given in proposition 3.5, which we think is probably near optimal in terms of speed (in arbitrary characteristic that is; in fixed positive characteristic, there are ways to speed this up significantly, for instance using proposition 3.12 (3),  but this is not done here and is not strictly necessary, since we have the ```mod_p``` function described below).  However, all of this is placed in the background, and so understanding multiplication in $\\text{Dist}(U_n)$ is not actually necessary (but would obviously be helpful for interpreting the results of your computations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since any unipotent algebraic group $G$ can be embedded in $U_n$ for some $n$, in fact $\\text{Dist}(G) \\subset \\text{Dist}(U_n)$ for some $n$ (see section 2), and so in principle this implementation can be used for doing computations in any $\\text{Dist}(G)$ for $G$ unipotent.  Once an embedding $G \\subset U_n$ is realized, the embedding $\\text{Dist}(G) \\subset \\text{Dist}(U_n)$ can be realized rather straightforwardly; see section 9.1 for an example of how the defining polynomials of $G$ (polynomial relations among the entries of $U_n$) correspond to \\textit{linear} relations among the basis elements of $\\text{Dist}(U_n)$.\n",
